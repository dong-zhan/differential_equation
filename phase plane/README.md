one way to learn differential equation is to get your hands dirty :)
I am studying http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/de/de_complete.pdf
this is one of example equation from the book.

this is the phase portrait of system of differential equations, real eigenvalues, example 1.
plotted with trajetory phase_portrait.py
